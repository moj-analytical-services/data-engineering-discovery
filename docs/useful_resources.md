## Comparisons of Hudi and Iceberg

- [Lakehouse Feature Comparison](https://www.onehouse.ai/blog/apache-hudi-vs-delta-lake-vs-apache-iceberg-lakehouse-feature-comparison) very thorough but written by OneHouse which develops Hudi-based solutions
- [Reassessing Performance](https://databeans-blogs.medium.com/delta-vs-iceberg-vs-hudi-reassessing-performance-cb8157005eb0) Published by databeans which develops deltalake-based solutions
