## AWS Interoperability

- [Get started with Apache Hudi using AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/part-1-get-started-with-apache-hudi-using-aws-glue-by-implementing-key-design-concepts/) How to get started with Apache Hudi on AWS glue and some available optimizations
- [Native support for Apache Hudi, Delta Lake, and Apache Iceberg on AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/part-1-getting-started-introducing-native-support-for-apache-hudi-delta-lake-and-apache-iceberg-on-aws-glue-for-apache-spark/)
- [Using Iceberg and Athena](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/querying-iceberg.html)
- [AWS workshop demonstrating some of the main functionality of Athena with iceberg](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/9981f1a1-abdc-49b5-8387-cb01d238bb78/en-US/90-athena-acid)
- [Documentation on developing with Glue locally using the official AWS Glue docker image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-etl-libraries.html#develop-local-docker-image)
- [Apache Iceberg on AWS with S3 and Athena](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGvj1gjbwl0) 
  - A useful introductory tutorial from Jonny Chivers on how Iceberg tables work and are different to Hive, and how to implement a database with Iceberg tables purely with Athena Presto SQL. 
  - A supporting tutorial is [SQL for Athena](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V21xjnHMOyk) where he builds a database on S3 purely with AWS Athena with Presto SQL, but with Hive tables. 
- [https://medium.com/expedia-group-tech/a-short-introduction-to-apache-iceberg-d34f628b6799](https://medium.com/expedia-group-tech/a-short-introduction-to-apache-iceberg-d34f628b6799) A dated but nice high level introduction to Iceberg tables
- Both Hudi and Iceberg are compatible with AWS LakeFormation (including e.g. column and cell level access). See [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/otf-tutorial.html) for the official documentation. For a lab that implements LakeFormation permissions for Hudi see [here](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/976050cc-0606-4b23-b49f-ca7b8ac4b153/en-US/1200/1211-hudi-lakeformation-lab) and for Iceberg see [here](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/976050cc-0606-4b23-b49f-ca7b8ac4b153/en-US/1200/1212-iceberg-lakeformation-lab).
